== Description ==
Dear user,
we revised "PR-Gateway Connect" and published an updated version of the plugin under a new name: Blog2Social. Blog2Social combines the proven features for individualizing and distributing your blog articles to your favorite social media profiles with new social media channels and more usability for a successful blog promotion. Please note that we don't maintain PR-Gateway Connect anymore. 
Please check and install our revised and rebranded version of the plugin:
[Go to Wordpress Plugin Blog2Social](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog2social/ "Go to Wordpress Plugin Blog2Social")

Important note: Please deactivate the old plugin "PR-Gateway Connect", before installing and activating "Blog2Social".

Feel free to test and rate Blog2Social and give us your feedback for one purpose: make Blog2Social your personal plugin.  
All your feedback is and will be used to improve and enhance Blog2Social for more pleasure to spread your word to the social community.
